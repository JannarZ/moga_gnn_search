# Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm with Graph Neural Network Surrogate

MOGA code in this project is used to make prediction of the physical realistic grain boundary (GB) structures of 2D materials.

## Usage
Python scripts in the matplotlib_ folder must be copied to the folder where the MOGA search is performed.
