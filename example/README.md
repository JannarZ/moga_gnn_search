Python enviroment with all prerequist packages was activated and the following command was excuted to start the search:

`python gnn_ga.py 2>&1 | bp1212_multiobj_ga_gnn_950train_new.out`

The potential file: `1212tersoff_950each_model_new.pt` was trained on the *complete Tersoff dataset* discussed in the [Citation section](moga_gnn_search/README.md/#citation).
GNN model code can be accessed in [this repository](https://github.com/JannarZ/gnn_bp_gb_tersoff).
